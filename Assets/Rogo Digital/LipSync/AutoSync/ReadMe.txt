AutoSync 2.0

Powered by PocketSphinx, a version of Carnegie Mellon University's CMU Sphinx library. It can optionally make use of the SoX - Sound eXchange commandline application for audio conversion, the license of which prevents it from being distributed with this software. For instructions on setting up SoX to work with LipSync, follow the included "Using SoX with AutoSync.pdf" guide.

Language Models are an important part of PocketSphinx, and it is necessary to have at least one in order to use AutoSync. They are usually around 30-50mb, so are not included by default to keep the package size down.
They can be downloaded from the Extensions Window.

AutoSync is intended as a rough way of speeding up the manual marker syncing process, it is not meant to entirely replace it. As such, we make no guarantees as to its accuracy or reliability.
